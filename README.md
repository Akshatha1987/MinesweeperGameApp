**Overview**
This project is a console-based game inspired by Minesweeper. The objective is to navigate across a chessboard-style grid while avoiding hidden mines. Players start with a set number of lives, losing one each time they hit a mine. The final score is determined by the total number of moves required to successfully reach the other side of the board.
